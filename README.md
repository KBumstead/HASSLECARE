# HASSLECARE

Frontend app for HassleCare

## Getting started

This is a static web page. You can run the app with any type of server. However, we suggest you to use `serve`

Install Node.js version 16 or higher. In the project directory, run

```
npm install
```

Run this to start the server

```
npm start
```

## Additional notes

This app assumes there is a running backend server located at https://alert-tourmaline-pantydraco.glitch.me/. This app should be bundled together with hasslecare-backend app. You can host the hasslecare-backend, then modify the base url in all pages in this app to target your own backend url.
